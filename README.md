## About

This Nuxt project uses Yarn, JavaScript (no TS), Vue and Vue templates. 

What is Nuxt?

> The Intuitive Vue Framework
> 
> Build your next Vue.js application with confidence using NuxtJS. An open source framework making web development simple and powerful.

See the [Nuxt homepage](https://nuxtjs.org/) for more info.

This project uses server-side rendering with Node, but also comes with the option to generate a static site. Follow [Documentation](#documentation) instructions below to setup and run the app locally.

Content is in the [pages](/pages/) directory as `.vue` files. The [Examples](https://nuxtjs.org/examples) section of the Nuxt docs covers a Hello World example which has multiple pages and can be run in the online sandbox.

## Create a fresh project

See the [Getting Started / Installation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation) Nuxt docs for more info.

This project was generated with this command:

```sh
$ yarn create nuxt-app nuxt-default-quickstart
```

All the default options were used, as follows:

```
âœ¨  Generating Nuxt.js project in nuxt-default-quickstart

? Programming language: JavaScript
? Package manager: Yarn
? UI framework: None
? Nuxt.js modules: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Linting tools: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Testing framework: None
? Rendering mode: Universal (SSR / SSG)
? Deployment target: Server (Node.js hosting)
? Development tools: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)

Username became lowercase even though entered as `MichaelCurrin`. The app suggested `Michael Currin`, perhaps from git name rather. I don't know how this gets used.


## Documentation

```

### Deploy

#### Server-side rendering
